													<p>Ever wondered how computer programming works, but haven't done anything more complicated on the web than upload a photo to Facebook?<br>

													Then you're in the right place.<br>

													To someone who's never coded before, the concept of creating a website from scratch -- layout, design, and all -- can seem really intimidating. You might be picturing Harvard students from the movie, The Social Network, sitting at their computers with gigantic headphones on and hammering out code, and think to yourself, 'I could never do that.'<br>

													Actually, you can.<br>

													Anyone can learn to code, just like anyone can learn a new language. In fact, programming is kind of like speaking a foreign language -- which is exactly why they're called programming languages. Each one has its own rules and syntax that need to be learned step by step. Those rules are ways to tell your computer what to do. More specifically, in web programming, they're ways of telling your browsers what to do.

													The goal of this post is to, in plain English, teach you with the basics of HTML, CSS, and one of the most common programming languages, JavaScript. But before we begin, let's get an idea of what programming languages actually are.<br><br>

													<h4><b>What Is a Programming Language?</b></h4><br>

													Programming, or coding, is like solving a puzzle. Consider a human language, like English or French. We use these languages to turn thoughts and ideas into actions and behavior. In programming, the goal of the puzzle is exactly the same -- you're just driving different kinds of behavior, and the source of that behavior isn't a human. It's a computer.<br>

													A <strong>programming language</strong> is our way of communicating with software. The people who use programming languages are often called programmers or developers. The things we tell software using a programming language could be to make a webpage look a certain way, or to make an object on the page move if the human user takes a certain action.<br><br>

													<h5><b>Programming in Web Development</b></h5><br>

													So, when a web designer is given an end goal like "create a webpage that has this header, this font, these colors, these pictures, and an animated unicorn walking across the screen when users click on this button," the web designer's job is to take that big idea and break it apart into tiny pieces, and then translate these pieces into instructions that the computer can understand -- including putting all these instructions in the correct order or syntax.<br>

													Every page on the web that you visit is built using a sequence of separate instructions, one after another. Your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and so on) is a big actor in translating code into something we can see on our screens and even interact with. It can be easy to forget that code without a browser is just a text file -- it's when you put that text file into a browser that the magic happens. When you open a web page, your browser fetches the HTML and other programming languages involved and interprets it.<br>

													HTML and CSS are actually not technically programming languages; they're just page structure and style information. But before moving on to JavaScript and other true languages, you need to know the basics of HTML and CSS, as they are on the front end of every web page and application.<br>

													In the very early 1990s, HTML was the only language available on the web. Web developers had to painstakingly code static sites, page by page. A lot's changed since then: Now there are many computer programming languages available.<br>

													In this post, I'll talk about HTML, CSS, and one of the most common programming languages: JavaScript.<br><br>

													<h2><b>HTML, CSS, & JavaScript: A Tutorial</b></h2><br>

													<b>HTML:</b> provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.<br><br>
													<b>CSS:</b> is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout.<br><br>
													<b>JavaScript:</b> is used to control the behavior of different elements.<br><br>
													Now, let's go over each one individually to help you understand the roles each plays on a website and then we'll cover how they fit together. Let's start with good ol' HTML.<br><br>

													<h3>HTML</h3><br>

													HTML is at the core of every web page, regardless the complexity of a site or number of technologies involved. It's an essential skill for any web professional. It's the starting point for anyone learning how to create content for the web. And, luckily for us, it's surprisingly easy to learn<br>

													HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. "Markup language" means that, rather than using a programming language to perform functions, HTML uses tags to identify different types of content and the purposes they each serve to the webpage.<br>

													Let me show you what I mean. Take a look at the article below. If I were to ask you to label the types of content on the page, you'd probably do pretty well: There's the header at the top, then a subheader below it, the body text, and some images at the bottom followed by a few more bits of text.<br>

													Markup languages work in the same way as you just did when you labeled those content types, except they use code to do it -- specifically, they use HTML tags, also known as "elements." These tags have pretty intuitive names: Header tags, paragraph tags, image tags, and so on.<br>

													Every web page is made up of a bunch of these HTML tags denoting each type of content on the page. Each type of content on the page is "wrapped" in, i.e. surrounded by, HTML tags.<br>

													For example, the words you're reading right now are part of a paragraph. If I were coding this web page from scratch (instead of using the WYSIWG editor in HubSpot's CMS), I would have started this paragraph with an opening paragraph tag: <span><b>. The "tag" part is denoted by open brackets, and the letter "p" tells the computer that we're opening a paragraph instead of some other type of content.<br>

													Once a tag has been opened, all of the content that follows is assumed to be part of that tag until you "close" the tag. When the paragraph ends, I'd put a closing paragraph tag: </b></span>. Notice that closing tags look exactly the same as opening tags, except there is a forward slash after the left angle bracket. Here's an example:<br>

													<p><b>This is a paragraph.</b></p><br>

													Using HTML, you can add headings, format paragraphs, control line breaks, make lists, emphasize text, create special characters, insert images, create links, build tables, control some styling, and much more.<br>

													To learn more about coding in HTML, I recommend checking out our guide to basic HTML, and using the free classes and resources on codecademy -- but for now, let's move on to CSS.<br><br>

													<h3>CSS</h3><br>

													CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This programming language dictates how the HTML elements of a website should actually appear on the frontend of the page.<br>

													HTML provides the raw tools needed to structure content on a website. CSS, on the other hand, helps to style this content so it appears to the user the way it was intended to be seen. These languages are kept separate to ensure websites are built correctly before they're reformatted.<br>

													<b>If HTML is the drywall, CSS is the paint.</b><br>

													Whereas HTML was the basic structure of your website, CSS is what gives your entire website its style. Those slick colors, interesting fonts, and background images? All thanks to CSS. This language affects the entire mood and tone of a web page, making it an incredibly powerful tool -- and an important skill for web developers to learn. It's also what allows websites to adapt to different screen sizes and device types.<br>

													To show you what CSS does to a website, look at the following two screenshots. The first screenshot is my colleague's blog post, but shown in Basic HTML, and the second screenshot is that same blog post with HTML and CSS.<br>

													Notice all the content is still there, but the visual styling isn't. This is what you might see if the style sheet doesn't load on the website, for whatever reason. Now, here's what the same web page looks like with CSS added.<br>

													<b>Isn't that prettier?</b>

													Put simply, CSS is a list of rules that can assign different properties to HTML tags, either specified to single tags, multiple tags, an entire document, or multiple documents. It exists because, as design elements like fonts and colors were developed, web designers had a lot of trouble adapting HTML to these new features.<br>

													You see, HTML, developed back in 1990, was not really intended to show any physical formatting information. It was originally meant only to define a document's structural content, like headers versus paragraphs. HTML outgrew these new design features, and CSS was invented and released in 1996: All formatting could be removed from HTML documents and stored in separate CSS (.css) files.<br>

													So, what exactly does CSS stand for? It stands for Cascading Style Sheets -- and "style sheet" refers to the document itself. Ever web browser has a default style sheet, so every web page out there is affected by at least one style sheet -- the default style sheet of whatever browser the web page visitor is using -- regardless whether or not the web designer applies any styles. For example, my browser's default font style is Times New Roman, size 12, so if I visited a web page where the designer didn't apply a style sheet of their own, I would see the web page in Times New Roman, size 12.<br>

													Obviously, the vast majority of web pages I visit don't use Times New Roman, size 12 -- that's because the web designers behind those pages started out with a default style sheet that had a default font style, and then they overrode my browser's defaults with custom CSS. That's where the word "cascading" comes into play. Think about a waterfall -- as water cascades down the fall, it hits all the rocks on the way down, but only the rocks at the bottom affect where it will end up flowing. In the same way, the last defined style sheet informs my browser which instructions have precedence.<br>

													To learn the specifics of coding in CSS, I'll point you again to the free classes and resources on codecademy. But for now, let's talk a bit about JavaScript.<br><br>

													<h3>JavaScript</h3><br>

													JavaScript is a more complicated language than HTML or CSS, and it wasn't released in beta form until 1995. Nowadays, JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers and is used on almost every site on the web for more powerful and complex functionality.<br>
													JavaScript is a logic-based programming language that can be used to modify website content and make it behave in different ways in response to a user's actions. Common uses for JavaScript include confirmation boxes, calls-to-action, and adding new identities to existing information.<br>

													In short, JavaScript is a programming language that lets web developers design interactive sites. Most of the dynamic behavior you'll see on a web page is thanks to JavaScript, which augments a browser's default controls and behaviors.<br><br>

													<h6><b>Creating Confirmation Boxes</b></h6><br>
                                                    
                                                    One example of JavaScript in action is boxes that pop up on your screen. Think about the last time you entered your information into an online form and a confirmation box popped up, asking you to press "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed. That was made possible because of JavaScript -- in the code, you'd find an "if ... else ..." statement that tells the computer to do one thing if the user clicks "OK," and a different thing if the user clicks "Cancel."<br><br>
                                                    <h6><b>Triggering Slide-In CTAs</b></h6><br>

                                                    Another example of JavaScript in action is a slide-in call-to-action (CTA), like the ones we put on our blog posts, which appears on the bottom right-hand side of your screen when you scroll past the end of the sidebar. Here's what it looks like:<br><br>
                                                     
                                                     <h6><b>Storing New Information</b></h6><br>

                                                     JavaScript is particularly useful for assigning new identities to existing website elements, according to the decisions the user makes while visiting the page. For example, let's say you're building a landing page with a form you'd like to generates leads from by capturing information about a website visitor. You might have a "string" of JavaScript dedicated to the user's first name. That string might look something like this:<br><br>

                                                     <b>function updateFirstname() {<br>

													let Firstname = prompt('First Name');<br>

													}</b><br><br>

													Then, after the website visitor enters his or her first name -- and any other information you require on the landing page -- and submits the form, this action updates the identity of the initially undefined "Firstname" element in your code. Here's how you might thank your website visitor by name in JavaScript:<br><br>

													<b>para.textContent = 'Thanks, ' + Firstname + "! You can now download your ebook."</b><br><br>

													In the string of JavaScript above, the "Firstname" element has been assigned the first name of the website visitor, and will therefore produce his or her actual first name on the frontend of the webpage. To a user named Kevin, the sentence would look like this:<br><br>

													<h3><b>Security, Games, and Special Effects</b></h3><br>

													Other uses for JavaScript include security password creation, check forms, interactive games, animations, and special effects. It's also used to build mobile apps and create server-based applications. You can add JavaScript to an HTML document by adding these "scripts," or snippets of JavaScript code, into your document's header or body.<br>

													If you want to learn more about JavaScript, codecademy has free online courses you can take, too.<br>

													The hardest part of coding is getting started -- but once you learn the basics, it'll be easier to learn more advanced programming languages. And if you ever feel overwhelmed, head over to hackertyper.net and hit random keys on your keyboard.

													<p>In this article, we will first try to answer the first question and then focus on the difference between <b>web design and website development.</b><br>

													To begin with, the term web development is as vast as the ocean. There are innumerable programming languages as well as scores of frameworks and tools that are the lifeline of technical web development.<br>

													Web development is indeed in the same boat as desktop and mobile app development. However, web development forms the basis of it all. Even with the rise of modern app development techniques, it still is undeniable that web development is the king. Therefore, even software developers have to know web development; or at least have a firm grasp of its basics.<br><br>

													<h4><b>Web Development Simplified</b></h4><br>

													The simplest way of describing web development is that it revolves around the creation of apps and tools that run on web browsers. These app and tools may be exclusively dependent on the server that created them. On the other hand, some of them may only use the server during their initial development or for data storage and retrieval among other things.<br><br>
                                                    
                                                    <h4><b>A Look at Web Development’s History</b></h4><br>

                                                    o understand the present and future of web development, and also know the difference between web design and web development,  let’s first try to understand its past.<br><br>

													The history of web development begun with static web pages and hyperlink navigation. Initially, developers would create static web pages and link them up using hyperlinks. Unlike today’s websites and web apps, there was minimal or no interactivity at all since these web pages were designed to simply convey information and nothing more.<br><br>

													CGI was used in the earlier days of web development to generate HTML based on data sent to the server by the browser. The developments that came later were designed to make CGI’s dynamic HTML generation easier. ASP and ColdFusion are examples of such developments and they served as a templating language for web development. Through them, HTML could be mixed with special tags and markup which made HTML generation easier, conditional and dependent on a particular web page.<br><br>

													JavaScript later sprung up to expand the capabilities of web tools and applications as computers were now faster and a newer technology was readily available to developers. CSS also made its appearance at around the same time as JavaScript. With CSS, developers could now style and change web content.<br><br>

													Even with the tremendous milestones already achieved, rendering was still so slow that web pages were hardly responsive. Technologies such as Asynchronous JavaScript and XML(AJAX) were thus developed to solve these problems and allow dynamic updates for web pages. With AJAX available, Single Page Applications (SPAs) could now be built. SPAs are web pages that don’t require any refreshing to update.
													Now you can use several approaches to create web applications.<br><br>

													Web development has continued to grow exponentially. Today, we even have web-based operating systems such as Google’s Chrome OS. Cloud technology too, has become so big in recent times that it’s hard to imagine what more the future holds in terms of web development. Also you can read more about modern web development and technologies which level up websites to the next era.<br><br>

													Many web platforms remain popular today. WordPress is one of them. Modern WordPress website development services include the web apps development, using modern JS libraries and frameworks. So, if you need a modern website or web app that based on time-tested solution, you able to use it.<br><br>

													<h4><b>Primary Web Development Technology</b></h4><br>

                                                    The commonest technologies that developers work with in the development of websites and web applications are HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.<br><br>

                                                    <h4><b>Primary Web Development Technology</b></h4><br>

                                                    HTML is the heart of web development. It forms the building blocks that developers use to create web applications. In fact, it is possible to code a complete website entirely on HTML.<br><br>

													HTML is a series of tags coded to define a web page’s format, layout, and components. All forms of web development run on HTML. On its own, HTML will nonetheless not accomplish much in rendering a page. It ought to be accompanied by JavaScript and CSS.<br><br>

													<h4><b>Cascading Style Sheets, CSS</b></h4><br>

													HTML was initially used to specify a web page’s format and layout. The problem, however, was that a lot of work had to be done in order to execute a small change in style. For instance, changing the color of buttons in a website, required an alteration of HTML in multiple places.<br><br>

													Nowadays, styling and web content are handled differently during development. HTML handles the content and CSS styles it. This way, one can use a small set of CSS files to style a whole web application. A single file can, for instance, be modified in CSS to change the color of the buttons on an entire site.<br><br:>

													<h4><b>JavaScript</b></h4><br>

													This is a programming language that allows the developer to manipulate web pages. By manipulating the model of a webpage using JavaScript, a developer can easily alter the style and structure of a webpage. This makes JavaScript a powerful resource with a critical role in web development.<br><br>

													<h4><b>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WEB DESIGN AND WEB DEVELOPMENT</b></h4><br>

													It’s common for people in the streets to use the term web designer when they mean web developer and vice versa. However, this is wrong. There is a difference between web design and web development.  A web designer and a web developer are very different professionals; each with a role that’s completely different from the other.<br><br>

													I too once held the misconception that web development and web designs are one and the same. However, if you ever find yourself touring the web industry, either as a client or professional, you’ll need to delineate web design from web development.<br><br>

													<h4><b>Web Design</b></h4><br>

													Web design is all about bringing ideas and web concepts to life. Web designers take your story or vision and create a design that is visually appealing. As such, they are tasked with designing how a website will look and feel. Much like an architect designs the plan before a house is built, so do web designers model a website layout before web developers can begin building the website. It is the layout that web designers create that is used to create the UX (User Experience) for the entire site.<br><br>

													The role of a web designer is often taken for granted by folks with little understanding of the job. It’s the designers that develop the entire environment that users find welcoming. They conjure up and create a blueprint for the ultimate user experience. This is no light job given that they have to begin working from a clean slate. All they have is a verbal or written idea of what a client wants. They then tug at this idea and transform it into usable web design. Therefore, it suffices the success of any web project greatly depends on the web designer who broke ground on the project.<br><br>

										            Typically, web designers start their work by analyzing the scope of a website; i.e. The purpose and focus of the site. After scrutinizing the scope as well as the features and specifications from the client, the designer will then sketch a model website. Next, they design wireframes and mock-ups. The final design of a website usually a layout of the web pages, typography, icons and buttons among other intricate features.<br><br>

													<h4><b>Features of Excellent Web Designers</b></h4><br>

													They are able to use tools such as Sketch, Photoshop and Illustrator to design a website.<br><br>
													They possess impeccable graphics and logo design skills.<br><br>
													They are always in the know on matters of the latest trends in design technology.<br><br>
													They are excellent branding masters.<br><br>
													From the roles performed by the web designer, we can understand beforehand that there is a big difference between web design and web development. If still not convinced, let’s move on and have a look at the web developer’s roles.<br><br>

													<h4><b>Web Development</b></h4><br>

													Once a website has been designed, it’s then passed onto the hands of web developers who then turn it into a live website. Developers, relying on a vast array of software, tools and languages, build the final website that users visit. Web development is as specialized as it is complicated. As such web developers can specialize in three fields;<br><br>

													<b>1.</b>Front-end development primarily deals with building the user interface of a website. Front-end developers create the interface of a website by relying on 3 main languages; JavaScript, CSS and HTML. In their line of work, they insert images, apply different typefaces, add animations and create pages background on top of many other things that enhance a website’s interface.<br><br>
													<b>2.</b>Back-end development involves more advanced programming that controls various features and interactions on web pages. This facet of development defines how the site works and how a user accomplishes different tasks using the functionality offered by the site. Developers here mainly deal with server requests and data. The developer, therefore, uses server languages such as ASP.NET and PHP as well as data query languages such as MySQL and SQL.<br><br>
													<b>3.</b>Full-stack development includes aspects of front-end as well as back-end development. Full-stack developers are well-versed in tools and languages that are needed to build a complete, fully-functional website from scratch. They possess adequate knowledge of design as well as user experience.<br><br>

													<h4><b>Conclusion</b></h4><br>

													In this article, we briefly explained the concept of web development and then highlighted the differences between a web designer and a web developer to make it easier for you to hire the right professional based on your project’s needs.<br><br>

													Nowadays UI/UX design moves a focus of the web development. The right UI/UX design is beneficial for business success, especially for startups.<br><br>

													We will soon be building on what we have discussed here today and talk about such things as server-side and client-side rendering. So, stay tuned to our blog for more..</p>

													<p>Bootstrap is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. It helps to build attractive websites. Bootstrap is a powerful, mobile-first front-end framework for faster and easier web development. Bootstrap provides a clean and uniform solution for building an interface for developers. WordPress is an open-source Content Management System (CMS), allows the users to build dynamic websites and blogs. WordPress is the tool for managing the media files and folder. WordPress is the most popular blogging system on the web and allows customizing, updating and managing the website from its back-end CMS (Content Management System) and components.<br><br>

													<h4><b>Bootstrap</b></h4><br>
                                                     
                                                     Bootstrap is open source framework which is used to develop responsive website and design. Bootstrap is also called an updated version of CSS. It is most popular framework for building responsive, mobile first site and application which works on grid system system for creating page layout through the series of rows and columns. It is compatible with all modern browsers.<br><br>

                                                     Bootstrap is developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton 19 August, 2011.<br><br>

                                                     Bootstrap is free open source CSS framework which is used to develop responsive Websites.<br><br>

                                                     Bootstrap written in HTML, CSS, less(v3), sass(v4), and JavaScript.<br><br>

                                                     Bootstrap is front-end framework which is used for designing and user interface of website.<br><br>

                                                     In Bootstrap there is no features of pre-existing theme.<br><br>

                                                     For developing website on Bootstrap you must have the knowledge of coding and strong understanding of HTML, CSS.<br><br>

                                                     In Bootstrap there is grid system to adjust the webpages on different section of website.<br><br>

                                                     <h4><b>WordPress</b></h4><br>
                                                     WordPress is an online open source tools which is written on PHP and it is used to create website and it is based on Content Management System(CMS). WordPress is a highly customizable and has literally thousands of plugin so you can use your website. It is used by approximately 75 million websites and the plugin of WordPress is highly flexible and simple interface, which reduces development cost and deployment time.<br><br>

                                                     WordPress is developed by Matt Mullenweg 27 May, 2003<br><br>

                                                     WordPress is also free open source Content Management System(CMS), which is used to develop dynamic website.<br><br>

                                                     WordPress written only on PHP.<br><br>

                                                     WordPress used both front-end and back-end for creating website.<br><br>

                                                     In WordPress you have lots of pre-existing themes which is used to create dynamic website.<br><br>

                                                     In WordPress you must know the customization of site and drag and drop features, which is easy as compared to Bootstrap.<br><br>
